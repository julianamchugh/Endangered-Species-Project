		<h2>Is it Real?</h2> 
		<br  />
		<p>The Fossa is most definitely 
		a real animal! The Fossa is a medium-sized carnivore that 
		is found exclusively on the island of Madagascar. The Fossa
		belongs to the Malagasy Carnivores group which are thought 
		to have descended from Mongoose-like ancestors that arrived
		on Madagascar from Africa up to 24 million years ago.</p>
		 <!-- This paragraph explains the fossa and its description-->
		<br  />
		<h2>What Exactly is a Fossa?</h2> 
		<br  />
		<p>The fossa is a cat-like, carnivorous mammal endemic to 
		Madagascar. It is known to feed on lemurs and most 
		other creatures it can get its claws on, from wild pigs to mice. 
		They are related to the mongoose family. Unlike mongooses, and 
		more like felines, the fossa has retractable claws and fearsome
		catlike teeth. Its coat is reddish brown and its muzzle resembles 
		that of a dog. Fossas have a long tail that comes in handy while hunting and 
		maneuvering amongst the tree branches.</p>

		<br  />
		<p>The fossa is found in Madagascar. It is also found in forested areas 
		and ranges from coastal lowlands to mountainous areas. The breeding age 
		is about four years. They are found within the Ankarana and Analamera 
		Special Reserves. In Madagascar that is their natural habitat and 
		environmental place. They like places that have plants and eco-plantation
		it also like to jump in high leafy trees like big trees. The fossa 
		population in Madagascar to be fewer than 2,500 individuals. </p>
		<br  />
		<p>The habitat
		loss is a main reason of the causes of decline, fragmented populations
		become isolated in remaining forests spots. It is one of madagascar's 
		largest predator. Humans although severely affected fossas, they are 
		often hunted by farmers for their livestock. In Madagascar there has 
		been deforestation of humans livestock. Humans think that they are 
		dangerous to humans which they are really not. To help conserve this 
		species by working in the field with Earth watch click <a href=
